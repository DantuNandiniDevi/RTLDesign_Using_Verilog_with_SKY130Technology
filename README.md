# Introduction
This is a submission of the cloud based 5-Day Workshop on RTL Design Using Verilog with SKY130 Technology. The tools used are iVerilog, GTKWave, Yosys and SKY130 Standard Cell Libraries.
- iVerilog is used to simulate the verilog code with the corresponding testbench. <br>
- Yosys is used to synthesize the verilog file and provide a netlist file. <br>
- SKY130 Standard Cell Library was used to infer the gates level netlist from the verilog modules. <br>
- GTKWave is used to view the simulation and synthesis waveform. <br>

The labs are being performed on a Ubuntu operating system with due installation of all the tools used.
